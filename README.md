# JavaExamples
This is a repository for all of the Java items mentioned and used in the Intro to Java tutorial videos.

## Folders
Each folder contains a handful of useful examples for a video that was taught. They include both the 'human readable' .java file and the 'computer readable' .class file for running.

## Disclaimer
All code is available for use in any purpose - feel free to 'smash n' grab' as the old saying goes.
